# Mini Project for Code Institute. CEM ADRIAN - Fan Website
## MilestoneMiniProject- Version 1.0 / 4 August 2018.

As it is my first commit, My wife suggested me to make a web site for a Turkish Singer "Cem Adrian". He is not too famous though his skills.

Actually, I tried to keep the things simple. One video from You Tube in the main Page, a biography Page, 6 sample music in mp3 format and a concert dates and places which can be found on the Google Maps.

Concert dates are intentionally chosen as the past dates as it is not an official Page.

I could have add a counter for the the concert starting hours and link it to ticket selling sites for the future concert dates.

## UX
This website is for the fans to listen sample music and to know about the when and where singers concerts are.

.As User, I want this young talent to be known internationally and use his skills internationally.

## Existing Features
Each Page are linked via Navigation Bar. At which Page, you are, CEM ADRIAN, when clicked on takes you to the main Page. Also, there is a toggle designed for dropdown menu items for the mobile devices.

Home Page includes only one sample video with well known pianist Fazil Say.

3.Sample Music- mp3
