# CEM ADRIAN - Mini Project for Code Institute.

+# MilestoneMiniProject- Version 1.0 4 August 2018.
As it is my first commit, My wife suggested me to make a web site for a Turkish Singer "Cem Adrian". He is not too famous though his skills. 

Actually, I tried to keep the things simple. One video from You Tube in the main Page, a biography Page, 6 sample music in mp3 format and
a concert dates and places which can be found on the Google Maps.

Concert dates are intentionally chosen as the past dates as it is not an official Page. 

I could have add a counter for the the concert starting hours and link it to ticket selling sites for the future concert dates.
